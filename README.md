hi every one 

this 2 little algorithms are for creating random perfect mazes and solving them , all you have to do is to give it the size of the maze

sorry for the french comments in the code 
(don't worry , french is waaay harder than java , i'm sure you can understand the code without the comments)


this could be helpful for a school assignment, if you hate getting a stackoverflow error in recurssive methodes  or in my case for a job interview .

the results of the solveing algorithm on my machine wer between 30 milliseconds and 120 milliseconds for a maze with a size of 1000 by 1000  . i guess it's less than 2 seconds :)  

and here is a pictuer of a generated maze :
